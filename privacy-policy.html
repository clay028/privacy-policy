    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: <strong>October 3, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Reformed Devotions</strong> (the “App”, "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our Android app and related services. By using the App you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Information you provide directly</h3>
    <p>We do not require you to create an account to use the core reading features. If you contact us (for support or feedback) you may provide personal information such as your name, email address, or other contact details.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically collected information</h3>
    <p>When you use the App, we may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (for example, advertising ID)</li>
      <li>Device model, operating system version, and app version</li>
      <li>Usage data (pages viewed, features used, timestamps)</li>
      <li>Crash and performance data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Content and network requests</h3>
    <p>The App can load online content (for example, the "Verse of the Day" from a Blogger site, or other remote content) into a WebView. When loading that content the servers hosting that content may receive requests that include your device IP address and user agent. We do not control the data practices of those external sites—see <strong>Third-Party Services</strong> below.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Offline data</h3>
    <p>The App stores a local copy of fallback verses and other app data (for offline use) on your device. This data is stored locally and is not uploaded to our servers unless you expressly use a feature that sends data to us.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate and maintain the App and provide the features you use.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage and improve the App's functionality and user experience.</li>
      <li>To respond to support requests and provide customer service.</li>
      <li>To serve personalized ads through third-party ad networks (see below).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Ads & Third-Party Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App displays advertisements provided by third-party ad networks (for example, Google AdMob). These networks may collect information about your device and use cookies, mobile identifiers, and similar technologies to show you personalized ads. We do not control the advertising networks’ data collection or use—please review their privacy policies for details and opt-out choices.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services to deliver functionality (for example, Blogger for hosting Verse-of-the-Day content, ad networks, or analytics providers). These third parties have their own privacy policies and data practices. Examples of third parties that may be used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ad networks (e.g., Google AdMob)</li>
      <li>Content hosts (e.g., Blogger)</li>
      <li>Analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics / Firebase) — if enabled</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please consult those services' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use data.</p>

    <h2>5. Local Storage & WebView</h2>
    <p>The App uses local storage on your device to cache verses and app settings so the App works offline. The WebView component used to display remote HTML content may store cookies and local data per the WebView's own settings and the remote site’s instructions.</p>

    <h2>6. Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal bases for processing personal data are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your consent where required (for certain analytics or personalization features).</li>
      <li>Our legitimate interests in operating, improving and securing the App (balanced against your rights).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your Rights (GDPR, CCPA and similar laws)</h2>
    <p>Where applicable you may have rights to access, correct, delete or restrict processing of your personal data. To make a request, contact us at the address below. We will respond according to applicable laws. If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the CCPA—contact us for details.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain the personal information we collect for as long as necessary to provide the App and fulfill the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data in our control. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure—please take care when sharing personal information.</p>

    <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected personal information from a child under the relevant age, please contact us and we will remove that data.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. If we make significant changes, we will provide a more prominent notice.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact Us</h2>
